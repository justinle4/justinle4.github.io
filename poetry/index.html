        Occasionally, I write poems to reflect what I am thinking about. Below are a few poems I have written. I hope to write more.

    <h1>
        A Barmaid's Rag
    </h1>
    <p>
        <i>
            A Barmaid's Rag glides across the countertop, <br>
            Sweeping up sorrowful spirits. <br>
            In the distance, a tune plays: <br>
            Ragtime. <br>
            <br><br>
            The Patrons hobble to the dance floor, <br>
            Overflowing with tonic spunk. <br>
            A shimmy offbeat; right feet then left feet: <br>
            Free time. <br>
            <br><br>
            "If only I could drink and dance through the day, <br>
            But nay! My duty binds me to this counter. <br>
            Up and down I roll this boulder burden. <br>
            Eternal time!" <br>
            <br><br>
            But the Barmaid joins the crowd, <br>
            Leaving the soggy Rag on the counter <br>
            Upon which it was thrown. <br>
            Does it leak the very same booze that it swept, <br>
            Or does it weep from being alone? <br>

    <h1>
      End of Autumn
    </h1>
    <p>
      <i>
        The orange-smiling Autumn sky <br>
        And that orange voice in her song: <br>
        The final moments of our happiness <br>
        Before grey-hearted Winter <br>
        Brings forth love's sorrow. <br>
      </i>

    <h1>
      Chocolate
    </h1>
    <p>
      <i>
        My love gifted me chocolate, <br>
        Wrapped with frightened hands <br>
        In a film of ephemeral plastic. <br>
        I tore off the wrapping and <br>
        Tossed a chunk into my mouth. <br>
        <br><br>
        I first felt an honest sweetness; <br>
        A tender saccharine embrace <br>
        Reminded me of the first time <br>
        I held my love in my arms. <br>
        <br><br>
        After this, a seducing savoryness. <br>
        The glands in my mouth deluged <br>
        From peanut and almond desire. <br>
        My cheeks flushed with craving. <br>
        <br><br>
        Then, the timid approach of salt &mdash; <br>
        Berber Sea salt boarded my palate. <br>
        A surprising advance from my love <br>
        With mysterious, brackish intent. <br>
        <br><br>
        Next came the feral bite of sourness: <br>
        Indignance slammed onto my tongue. <br>
        My shriveling face contorted into <br>
        That of an ornery, old-lemon man. <br>
        <br><br>
        Finally, the arrival of cruel bitterness, <br>
        As leather blight swept my mouth. <br>
        I fearfully swallowed what felt like <br>
        A hatred stewing for one thousand years. <br>
        <br><br>
        But my love had a guiltless smile, <br>
        So I chuckled, while exclaiming: <br>
        “Excellent and curious, my love!” <br>
        For how could I thrust the acrid truth <br>
        Onto this face of chocolate? <br>
