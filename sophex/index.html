    The Sophex seminar is a seminar run by first-year mathematics graduate students at UT Austin that is designed to be a safe space for first-year students to practice speaking and to facilitate getting to know each other. 
    This is achieved by only letting first and second-year students attend talks. Below are the talks for the 2025-2026 academic year.
    <br><br>
    For the 2025-2026 academic year, the Sophex seminar meets on Fridays from 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM in PMA 12.166 (12th floor classroom), followed by dinner at a nearby location.
    <br><br>
    If you would like to present a talk in Spring 2026, please email the Sophex seminar organizers Justin Le (<a href=mailto:justinle[at]utexas.edu>justinle[at]utexas.edu</a>) 
    or Kazi Aryan Amin (<a href=mailto:aryanamin[at]utexas.edu>aryanamin[at]utexas.edu</a>).

    <h3> Fall 2025 </h3>
    <p> </p>
    <p> September 5: &nbsp; Kazi Aryan Amin </p>
    <p style="margin-left:108px"> <i> Horror movies that changed the genre </i></p>
    <p style="margin-left:108px;">I'll be talking about movies which mark inflection points in horror history. These, while not necessarily being the 'best to do it', 
      either introduced a new trope, sparked movements, or broadened audience expectations in a new aspect, and in general heavily 
      influenced movies that came after them. 
    </p>

    <p> September 12: Viktoria Ipatenkova </p>
    <p style="margin-left:108px"> <i> On a Sufficient Condition for Chair Vacancy: A Dynamical Systems Analysis of Auditory-Stimulated Locomotion in Homo sapiens </i></p>
    <p style="margin-left:108px;">This presentation will explore a conjectured sufficient condition for the non-equilibrium state of a human subject relative to a seated position—a phenomenon colloquially known 
      as "you won't sit on your chair." We will formally posit that the auditory input of a specific class of music, herein defined as "popular music" or "pop," serves as a sufficient trigger for this state 
      transition. The talk will model the human postural control system as a dynamical system where the application of this auditory stimulus acts as a forcing function, destabilizing the system's equilibrium 
      (sitting) and inducing a phase transition into a non-stationary, rhythmic state (dancing). Our analysis will proceed chronologically, tracing the topological evolution of this forcing function's 
      parameters—melody, rhythm, and harmonic structure—from its foundational axioms in the mid-20th century to its complex manifestations in the 2010s. The talk will conclude with an interactive segment 
      applying our model to a series of case studies from the 2010s. The audience will be challenged to identify the artist based solely on a minimal set of sonic features, testing the robustness of our 
      proposed classification metrics. Furthermore, we will examine edge cases and pathological examples—so-called "cringe" states—where the system's response deviates from the predicted attractor, leading 
      to unstable or chaotic behavioral outputs.

    <p> September 19: Abiel Quinonez </p>
    <p style="margin-left:108px"> <i> How to Build a PC in 2025 </i></p>
    <p style="margin-left:108px;">Are you getting absolutely destroyed in Fortnite and are too stubborn to play a different game for whatever reason? Is your $500 MacBook from 2017 not cutting it for putting 
      together PowerPoint presentations anymore? Well fear not, as I, by virtue of visiting every nook and cranny of the internet in the span of a few days, am the most qualified person on Earth to help you get 
      the boost that you so desperately need. In this seminar, I will discuss how to choose components that will take your computing experience to another dimension. We will begin with an overview of the 
      components that you will need, and then we will evaluate different choices that are currently available on the market to determine which ones give you the most bang for your buck. By the end of the talk, 
      the sequences of characters "9950X" and "5070 Ti" will hopefully have a very special place in your heart...
    <p> September 26: Dillon Grannis </p>
    <p style="margin-left:108px"> <i> Introduction to Nondeterministic Theater </i></p>
    <p style="margin-left:108px;">In traditional theater, actors perform a predetermined plot. They are given props, dialogue and stage directions. None of these are provided in improvisational acting, 
      often abbreviated as “improv”. I will provide an introduction containing: </p>
    <ul style="margin-left:85px">
      <li>The rules of improv</li>
      <li>General tips</li>
      <li>Prepared examples</li>
      <li>Live demonstration</li>
    </ul>
    <p> October 3: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hillary Kim</p>
    <p style="margin-left:105px"> <i> Constructions of Applicable Diagrams </i></p>
    <p style="margin-left:105px;">We will be going over a step by step process of constructing highly applicable diagrams. No matter what area of math you are in, you will definitely use these diagrams 
      in your career. <strong>Please bring paper and a writing utensil</strong>. At the end of the talk we will vote on the best diagram, with a tremendous prize involved. 
    <p> October 10: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ben Lyons</p>
    <p style="margin-left:105px"> <i> Nebraska </i></p>
    <p style="margin-left:105px;">Have you ever visited Nebraska? If not, no worries! I will introduce my home state, specifically its geography, the best sights to visit (in my opinion), and famous people. 
      In addition, I will discuss the specific part of Nebraska that I am from, Washington County. Finally, I will interactively present some of Nebraska's landscapes. 
    <p> October 17: Justin Chen</p>
    <p> October 24: William Pan</p>
    <p> October 31: Justin Le</p>
    <p> November 7: Henry Glunz </p>
