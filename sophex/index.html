    The Sophex seminar is a seminar run by first-year mathematics graduate students at UT Austin that is designed to be a safe space for first-year students to practice speaking and to facilitate getting to know each other. 
    This is achieved by only letting first and second-year students attend talks. Below are the talks for the 2025-2026 academic year.
    <br><br>
    For the 2025-2026 academic year, the Sophex seminar meets on Fridays from 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM in PMA 12.166 (12th floor classroom), followed by dinner at a nearby location.
    <br><br>
    If you would like to present a talk in Spring 2026, please email the Sophex seminar organizers Justin Le (<a href=mailto:justinle[at]utexas.edu>justinle[at]utexas.edu</a>) 
    or Kazi Aryan Amin (<a href=mailto:aryanamin[at]utexas.edu>aryanamin[at]utexas.edu</a>).

    <p style="margin-left:108px"> <i> Horror movies that changed the genre</i></p>
    <p style="margin-left:108px;">I'll be talking about movies which mark inflection points in horror history. These, while not necessarily being the 'best to do it', 
      either introduced a new trope, sparked movements, or broadened audience expectations in a new aspect, and in general heavily 
      influenced movies that came after them.

    <p style="margin-left:108px"> <i> On a Sufficient Condition for Chair Vacancy: A Dynamical Systems Analysis of Auditory-Stimulated Locomotion in Homo sapiens </i></p>
    <p style="margin-left:108px;">This presentation will explore a conjectured sufficient condition for the non-equilibrium state of a human subject relative to a seated position—a phenomenon colloquially known 
      as "you won't sit on your chair." We will formally posit that the auditory input of a specific class of music, herein defined as "popular music" or "pop," serves as a sufficient trigger for this state 
      transition. The talk will model the human postural control system as a dynamical system where the application of this auditory stimulus acts as a forcing function, destabilizing the system's equilibrium 
      (sitting) and inducing a phase transition into a non-stationary, rhythmic state (dancing). Our analysis will proceed chronologically, tracing the topological evolution of this forcing function's 
      parameters—melody, rhythm, and harmonic structure—from its foundational axioms in the mid-20th century to its complex manifestations in the 2010s. The talk will conclude with an interactive segment 
      applying our model to a series of case studies from the 2010s. The audience will be challenged to identify the artist based solely on a minimal set of sonic features, testing the robustness of our 
      proposed classification metrics. Furthermore, we will examine edge cases and pathological examples—so-called "cringe" states—where the system's response deviates from the predicted attractor, leading 
      to unstable or chaotic behavioral outputs.
