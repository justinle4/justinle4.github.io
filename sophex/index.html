    The Sophex seminar is a seminar run by first-year mathematics graduate students at UT Austin that is designed to be a safe space for first-year students to practice speaking and to facilitate getting to know each other. 
    This is achieved by only letting first and second-year students attend talks. Below are the talks for the 2025-2026 academic year.
    <br><br>
    For the 2025-2026 academic year, the Sophex seminar meets on Fridays from 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM. In the Fall semester, Sophex was held in PMA 12.166 (12th floor classroom), while in the Spring semester, 
    it is held in PMA 11.176 (11th floor classroom). All talks are followed by dinner at a nearby location.

    <p> </p>
    <p> September 5: &nbsp; Kazi Aryan Amin </p>
    <p style="margin-left:108px"> <i> Horror movies that changed the genre </i></p>
    <p style="margin-left:108px;">I'll be talking about movies which mark inflection points in horror history. These, while not necessarily being the 'best to do it', 
      either introduced a new trope, sparked movements, or broadened audience expectations in a new aspect, and in general heavily 
      influenced movies that came after them. 
    </p>

    <p> September 12: Viktoria Ipatenkova </p>
    <p style="margin-left:108px"> <i> On a Sufficient Condition for Chair Vacancy: A Dynamical Systems Analysis of Auditory-Stimulated Locomotion in Homo sapiens </i></p>
    <p style="margin-left:108px;">This presentation will explore a conjectured sufficient condition for the non-equilibrium state of a human subject relative to a seated position—a phenomenon colloquially known 
      as "you won't sit on your chair." We will formally posit that the auditory input of a specific class of music, herein defined as "popular music" or "pop," serves as a sufficient trigger for this state 
      transition. The talk will model the human postural control system as a dynamical system where the application of this auditory stimulus acts as a forcing function, destabilizing the system's equilibrium 
      (sitting) and inducing a phase transition into a non-stationary, rhythmic state (dancing). Our analysis will proceed chronologically, tracing the topological evolution of this forcing function's 
      parameters—melody, rhythm, and harmonic structure—from its foundational axioms in the mid-20th century to its complex manifestations in the 2010s. The talk will conclude with an interactive segment 
      applying our model to a series of case studies from the 2010s. The audience will be challenged to identify the artist based solely on a minimal set of sonic features, testing the robustness of our 
      proposed classification metrics. Furthermore, we will examine edge cases and pathological examples—so-called "cringe" states—where the system's response deviates from the predicted attractor, leading 
      to unstable or chaotic behavioral outputs.

    <p> September 19: Abiel Quinonez </p>
    <p style="margin-left:108px"> <i> How to Build a PC in 2025 </i></p>
    <p style="margin-left:108px;">Are you getting absolutely destroyed in Fortnite and are too stubborn to play a different game for whatever reason? Is your $500 MacBook from 2017 not cutting it for putting 
      together PowerPoint presentations anymore? Well fear not, as I, by virtue of visiting every nook and cranny of the internet in the span of a few days, am the most qualified person on Earth to help you get 
      the boost that you so desperately need. In this seminar, I will discuss how to choose components that will take your computing experience to another dimension. We will begin with an overview of the 
      components that you will need, and then we will evaluate different choices that are currently available on the market to determine which ones give you the most bang for your buck. By the end of the talk, 
      the sequences of characters "9950X" and "5070 Ti" will hopefully have a very special place in your heart...
    <p> September 26: Dillon Grannis </p>
    <p style="margin-left:108px"> <i> Introduction to Nondeterministic Theater </i></p>
    <p style="margin-left:108px;">In traditional theater, actors perform a predetermined plot. They are given props, dialogue and stage directions. None of these are provided in improvisational acting, 
      often abbreviated as “improv”. I will provide an introduction containing: </p>
    <ul style="margin-left:85px">
      <li>The rules of improv</li>
      <li>General tips</li>
      <li>Prepared examples</li>
      <li>Live demonstration</li>
    </ul>
    <p> October 3: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hillary Kim</p>
    <p style="margin-left:105px"> <i> Constructions of Applicable Diagrams </i></p>
    <p style="margin-left:105px;">We will be going over a step by step process of constructing highly applicable diagrams. No matter what area of math you are in, you will definitely use these diagrams 
      in your career. <strong>Please bring paper and a writing utensil</strong>. At the end of the talk we will vote on the best diagram, with a tremendous prize involved. 
    <p> October 10: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ben Lyons</p>
    <p style="margin-left:105px"> <i> Nebraska </i></p>
    <p style="margin-left:105px;">Have you ever visited Nebraska? If not, no worries! I will introduce my home state, specifically its geography, the best sights to visit (in my opinion), and famous people. 
      In addition, I will discuss the specific part of Nebraska that I am from, Washington County. Finally, I will interactively present some of Nebraska's landscapes. 
    <p> October 17: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Justin Chen</p>
    <p style="margin-left:105px"> <i> A PMA Dungeons and Dragons Adventure </i></p>
    <p style="margin-left:105px;">The veil between the mundane and magical worlds is thinner than you'd expect. Behind the veil, there are great powers who can grant you everything you wish for. 
      Insight. Theorems. Never having to take a prelim exam again. But to draw on their power is to sign a Faustian bargain. Who knows what will happen once the deal has gone too far...
    <p> October 24: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; William Pan</p>
    <p style="margin-left:105px"> <i> Field Trip to Texas Inventionworks Makerspace! </i></p>
    <p style="margin-left:105px;"> For spooky season we'll venture into the deep, scary trenches of engineering students pulling all-nighters and going insane working on their senior year projects. 
      On a positive note, the Texas Inventionworks Makerspace in EER lets you satisfy your creative cravings with machines for 3D printing, woodworking, sewing, sticker printing, laser cutting, electronics,
      and more! We'll follow a tour given by an undergraduate student working there. <br><br>
      For safety, wear closed-toed shoes and something to secure long hair. Leave backpacks in your office before coming to PMA 12.166. After a short introduction I will walk everyone to EER.
    <p> October 31: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Justin Le</p>
    <p style="margin-left:105px"> <i> The Spooky Sophex Showdown! </i></p>
    <p style="margin-left:105px;"> Upon this Hallow's Eve, a contest of costume caliber hath come to Sophex! Dazzle your fellow PhD students with your costume, whether it be wicked, whimsical, or winsome.
      We will unearth the most excellent ensemble in our midst, and to the victor will go the victuals! For the dauntless who dare to have their deeds drawn in immortality, come this Friday with your outfit

    <p> November 7: &nbsp;&nbsp;Peter Seong </p>
    <p style="margin-left:105px"> <i> How to make Korean food?  </i></p>
    <p style="margin-left:105px;"> I want to share my hobby of cooking. My favorite thing about my country is food. Korean food is healthy and easy to make. I recently started to make Kimchi at home and it's 
      amazing. Check <a href="https://mikepierce.github.io/grothendieck-kimchi/translations/english/">Alexander Grothendieck's essay</a> (translated in English) on Kimchi. I will share some top secret tips on 
      making Kimchi. </p>

    <p> November 21:&nbsp; Jiahua Song</p>
    <p style="margin-left:105px"> <i> The Calculus of Flying: Optimal Control Meets Aerial Photography  </i></p>
    <p style="margin-left:105px;">  In this talk, I will explore how mathematical ideas shape the way a drone moves and how we capture the world from above. By viewing drone flight through the lens of optimal 
      control and calculus of variations, we can model a flight path as an energy-minimizing trajectory—essentially a smooth “geodesic in the air.” I'll introduce a simple control formulation, show how it 
      leads to cubic-spline-like optimal paths, and connect these ideas to real flying behavior. </p>
      <p style="margin-left:105px;"> I'll also share some of my aerial photography of several cities. The talk will conclude with a live drone-pilot perspective of UT Austin, offering a visual tour of the campus from above. </p>
